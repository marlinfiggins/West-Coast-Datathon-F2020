## Problem statement
- "Your goal is to analyze movie data, potentially in combination with supplementary data sets, **to determine interesting and meaningful implications about consumer preferences**"

## Sample questions:
- Small differences in system designs leads to impacts on the data collected. Can we collect differences and how does it change our interpretation of the data?
- Are user ratings predictive of which films and actors are nominated for academy awards?
- How does variance within a user's ratings tend to affect model accuracy? 

## What are some interesting hypotheses for consumer preferences?
- MF: Are rating quality even indicative of total consumption in the first place?

## Data sets provided

1. Movie Lens
- Movies,Ratings, Genome-tags, tags, genome-scores, links

2. Oscar Awards
- All Academy Awards nominations since 1927

3. Movie Industry
